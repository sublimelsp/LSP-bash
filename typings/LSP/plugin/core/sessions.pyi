    def name(cls) -> str:
        '''
        A human-friendly name. If your plugin is called "LSP-foobar", then this should return "foobar". If you also
        have your settings file called "LSP-foobar.sublime-settings", then you don\'t even need to re-implement the
        configuration method (see below).
        '''
    @classmethod
    def configuration(cls) -> tuple[sublime.Settings, str]:
        '''
        Return the Settings object that defines the "command", "languages", and optionally the "initializationOptions",
        "default_settings", "env" and "tcp_port" as the first element in the tuple, and the path to the base settings
        filename as the second element in the tuple.

        The second element in the tuple is used to handle "settings" overrides from users properly. For example, if your
        plugin is called LSP-foobar, you would return "Packages/LSP-foobar/LSP-foobar.sublime-settings".

        The "command", "initializationOptions" and "env" are subject to template string substitution. The following
        template strings are recognized:

        $file
        $file_base_name
        $file_extension
        $file_name
        $file_path
        $platform
        $project
        $project_base_name
        $project_extension
        $project_name
        $project_path

        These are just the values from window.extract_variables(). Additionally,

        $storage_path The path to the package storage (see AbstractPlugin.storage_path)
        $cache_path   sublime.cache_path()
        $temp_dir     tempfile.gettempdir()
        $home         os.path.expanduser(\'~\')
        $port         A random free TCP-port on localhost in case "tcp_port" is set to 0. This string template can only
                      be used in the "command"

        The "command" and "env" are expanded upon starting the subprocess of the Session. The "initializationOptions"
        are expanded upon doing the initialize request. "initializationOptions" does not expand $port.

        When you\'re managing your own server binary, you would typically place it in sublime.cache_path(). So your
        "command" should look like this: "command": ["$cache_path/LSP-foobar/server_binary", "--stdio"]

    Register an LSP plugin in LSP.

    will start for the relevant views.

    While your helper package may still work without calling `register_plugin` in `plugin_loaded`, the user will have a
    better experience when you do call this function.

    Your implementation should look something like this:

    ```python
